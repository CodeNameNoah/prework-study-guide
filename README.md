## Description

- This Pre-Work Study Guide was designed with the goal of assisting with other like-minded peers as to myself who is eager to learn about HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript and many more Coding terms.

- What was your motivation? - My motivation was to become exceptionally well-versed in computational thinking, coding terminology, and be able to practice coding in an moderate level to further be utilized as the start of the Coding Boot Camp nears.
- Why did you build this project? - I decided to build this project to develop my coding skills through various coding platforms like HTML, CSS, JS, and the general use of terminals and Git. I am happy to say I learned an outstanding amount and am reviewing my reading materials each day to understand terms such as elements, variables, metadata, header, footers, etc.
- What problem does it solve? - This project has solved the issue of eager students looking for a interesting and interactive study guide to learning the more well-known coding platforms. Scholars may utilize my Prework Study Guide to learn about command blocks, and seeing first hand how they can make their own website by following along the instructions I have utilized from the UC Berkeley Coding Camp Prework.
- What did you learn? - I learned the professional etiquette in working as a web developer or programmer. I learned how HTML is an annotation coding language which describes a document and its counterpart data. I had also learned how JavaScript is a commanding coding language which instructs the items within an HTML document what to do. CSS is a styling coding language which helps to style or decorate the elements of an HTML document. Knowing all three helps to learn how they all interact with each other and contribute to make a whole website.
